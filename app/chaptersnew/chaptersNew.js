      <p>“But Madame President, we’re going to die!”</p>
      <p>
        There was a deep breath heard through the phone followed by a long sigh.
      </p>
      <p>“My love, I know.”</p>
      <p>“And you still won’t help?”</p>
      <p>
        This was out of character for the President. Ever since everyone called
        her ‘Harri’, Jūratė never knew now-President Harriet Jefferson to back
        down from a just fight. She was always on fire to change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You-rah..” Harri was one of the last who called Jūratė by her American
        name – Jura. Waves of nostalgia filled Jūratė from the days when
        everyone unknowingly called her ‘Sea.’ “The American people don’t see
        why we should care about a war in Eastern Europe.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Jūratė’s heart sank. Everyone and everything she knows, irrelevant.
        “Please don’t look away. You can’t look away, Harri.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m not looking away, my love. But I need to convince the American
        people. Tell me - when has American freedom ever had anything to do with
        Eastern Europe?”
      </p>
      <p>“Since the beginning! Ask your family.”</p>
      <p>“The Jefferson or Hemmings side? I’m trying to help.”</p>
      <p>“Both! But even now. What about hybrid warfare?”</p>
      <p>“Ok. What about hybrid warfare?”</p>
      <p>
        “Hybrid warfare is actively hurting America, but it’d be worse if it
        weren’t for us. You heard of–”
      </p>
      <p>There was a crash outside. The line was cut. Did war finally come?</p>

      <p className="title">Chapter 2</p>

      <p>“Oh, no no no no no no no no no no.”</p>
      <p>“What is it?”</p>
      <p>“Kastyti, that lightning strike cut my call with Harri.”</p>
      <p>
        Kastytis let out a chuckle. And another two. Finally he bellied out a
        laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Didn’t a lightning strike interrupt something important before? You
        should stop angering Perkūnas.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jūratė grumbled. Perkūnas, thunder or even the thunder god himself, was
        indeed outside and mad.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes this is the third time! And not funny, she’s probably terrified.”
      </p>
      <p>“What were you talking about?”</p>
      <p>“War.”</p>
      <p>Kastytis laughed a little harder. “She’s definitely terrified.”</p>
      <p>
        Jūratė fell back onto their leather couch and threw her phone onto the
        coffee table. “Why did you make our vacation retreat so disconnected
        from the outside world?”
      </p>
      <p>“Because you asked for it.”</p>
      <p>“Mmmmmmmm... But why did you listen to me?”</p>
      <p>
        Kastytis started to develop that sinister look that said ‘maybe I should
        stop listening to you.’
      </p>
      <p>
        “Kastyti, I’m starting to not like this conversation. You catch any fish
        before the storm today?”
      </p>

      <p className="title">Chapter 3</p>

      <p>
        “The hell? What was that? What was that noise before the call dropped?”
      </p>
      <p>
        President Jefferson pulled the phone away from her ear. Two staffers
        pulled out their phones and began typing away frantically.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I can check with NSA, CIA, and EYE to see if there was a strike. See if
        Russia did anything.”
      </p>
      <p>“I’ll check if any news outlets are picking anything up.”</p>
      <p>
        The President set the phone down as she stood up from behind the
        mahogany Resolute Desk. “Let’s keep it low key for now, okay? Bring over
        IT to see if they can trace what happened with the call.
      </p>
      <p>I’ve got other things to do.”</p>
      <p>
        The staffers didn’t look up from their phones as they stood up from
        their chairs. The President walked right past them towards the door.
        “Call in David Perez. He might be able to help with Jura’s problem.”
      </p>
      <p>“The oil and gas lobbyist?”</p>
      <p>
        The President stopped and turned around. “You sound like you’ve got a
        problem with that.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The staffer lowered his phone. “Is there anyone we won’t work with?”
      </p>
      <p>
        President Jefferson took a step towards him. “You’ve got heart, my dear.
        Don’t lose that. I’ll show you what happens when you’ve got heart and
        are fearless.”
      </p>

      <p className="title">Chapter 4</p>
      <p>
        As Kastytis started answering about his daily catch, Jūratė caught a
        glance of the headline on her phone that prompted the call to Harri.
      </p>
      <p>“Not much today. I did catch a 30 cm (~1ft) perch though.”</p>
      <p>
        Jūratė leaned into Kastytis’ shoulder. Grasping for distraction from the
        news, she placed her hand on his chest and began massaging her finger
        over his wool flannel shirt.
      </p>
      <p>“Oh. 30 cm?”</p>
      <p>“Mmm. Put up a real good fight.”</p>
      <p>
        Jūratė moved her hand over to his shirt button. Slowly, she clipped open
        the button.
      </p>
      <p>“I’m sure that perch was no match for you.”</p>
      <p>
        His shirt opened, giving Jūratė the slip she needed to slide her hand
        onto his warm chest. She brought her chin up, bringing her lips to
        Kastytis.
      </p>
      <p>“Hey, Mama?”</p>
      <p>
        Jūratė’s daughter rounded the corner and stopped at the sight of her mom
        removing her hand from under her dad’s shirt.
      </p>
      <p>“Yes, Eglė?”</p>
      <p>“Were you guys just..? Cute. I’ll give you your space.”</p>
      <p>
        Jūratė lost the romantic momentum. She turned around to lean back
        against Kastytis’ shoulder and grabbed her phone to look at the headline
        still flashing on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘US House passes bill to leave the Friends Together Alliance.’ The news
        was coming for years, but she still couldn’t really believe it.
      </p>
      <p>Kastytis looked over her shoulder. “Important news?”</p>
      <p>
        “Really important. The US might leave the Friends Together Alliance.”
      </p>
      <p>Kastytis nodded his head along. He had no idea what that meant.</p>
      <p>
        Jūratė got the signal. “If the US leaves the Friends Together Alliance,
        we’re open to Russian invasion.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Kastytis blinked. “Won’t the rest of the Friends Together Alliance
        protect us?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Jūratė wasn’t used to Kastytis showing any signs of political acumen.
        “We‘re losing one outside protector.
      </p>
      <p>Are we not going to learn our lesson?”</p>
      <p>Kastytis shrugged his shoulders. “What else can we do?”</p>

      <p>
        Jūratė put the phone away and laid her head on her husband’s lap.
        „Isolated, the crow dreads the hawk. A murder of crows leaves the hawk
        frozen in fear.“
