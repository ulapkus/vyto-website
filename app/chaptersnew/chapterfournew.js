        As Kastytis started answering about his daily catch, Jūratė caught a
        glance of the headline on her phone that prompted the call to Harri.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Not much today. I did catch a 30 cm (~1ft) perch though.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jūratė leaned into Kastytis’ shoulder. Grasping for distraction from the
        news, she placed her hand on his chest and began massaging her finger
        over his wool flannel shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Oh. 30 cm?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Mmm. Put up a real good fight.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jūratė moved her hand over to his shirt button. Slowly, she clipped open
        the button.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m sure that perch was no match for you.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        His shirt opened, giving Jūratė the slip she needed to slide her hand
        onto his warm chest. She brought her chin up, bringing her lips to
        Kastytis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Hey, Mama?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jūratė’s daughter rounded the corner and stopped at the sight of her mom
        removing her hand from under her dad’s shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Yes, Eglė?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Were you guys just..? Cute. I’ll give you your space.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jūratė lost the romantic momentum. She turned around to lean back
        against Kastytis’ shoulder and grabbed her phone to look at the headline
        still flashing on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>‘US House passes bill to leave the Friends Together Alliance.’</i>{" "}
        The news was coming for years, but she still couldn’t really believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kastytis looked over her shoulder. <i>“Important news?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “Really important. The US might leave the Friends Together Alliance.”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Kastytis nodded his head along. He had no idea what that meant.</p>
      <p>
        Jūratė got the signal.{" "}
        <i>
          “If the US leaves the Friends Together Alliance, we’re open to Russian
          invasion.”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Kastytis blinked.{" "}
        <i>“Won’t the rest of the Friends Together Alliance protect us?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jūratė wasn’t used to Kastytis showing any signs of political acumen.
        <i>
          “We‘re losing one outside protector. Are we not going to learn our
          lesson?”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Kastytis shrugged his shoulders. <i>“What else can we do?”</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Jūratė put the phone away and laid her head on her husband’s lap.
        <i>
          „Isolated, the crow dreads the hawk. A murder of crows leaves the hawk
          frozen in fear.“
