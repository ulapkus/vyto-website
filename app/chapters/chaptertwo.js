        {`President Jefferson set the phone down. Her knees buckled. Atlas, it
        appeared, set more weight on her shoulders.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`For years, a growing population in America felt like the government
        hadn’t prioritized their needs. As a candidate, Harriet made the promise
        that she’d pay attention.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`No matter how deeply she related to the story of a people starving for
        freedom, starved by others who couldn’t understand or empathize, her
        hands were tied. Democracy demanded it.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`She stood up tall and brought her chin up. She was President Harriet
        Jefferson, after all. She wielded power that the first President
        Jefferson couldn’t even imagine.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`She’d have to pull herself together before stepping into the Oval to
        meet with David Perez.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`My dear reader, there is something you should understand about David
        Perez. David Perez had a gravitational pull towards power.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`So when President Jefferson walked into the Oval, the air was thick.
        Both monitored their breathing, careful not to let their powers collide.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`David lifted his shoulder as he extended a handshake. President
        Jefferson was grateful David opted for the shake over the hug.`}
      </p>
      <p>{`“How can I help you, David?”`}</p>
      <p>
        {`David watched as President Jefferson settled behind the Resolute Desk,
        opened her notebook, and clicked her pen. Always with that damn
        notebook. It unnerved him to be in the presence of such a prepared
        politician.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`“Madam President, I’m here today on behalf of my client, the Oil, Gas, &
        Green Energy Industry Association. They’re having a cow about leaving
        the Friends Together Alliance.`}
      </p>
      <p>{`President Jefferson jotted something in her notebook. “Oh yea?”`}</p>
      <p>{`David composed himself. “You remember the Great Power Outage?”`}</p>
      <p>
        {`She peered over her glasses. “You mean the one where I had to learn to
        heat my house by woodfire, communicate by letter, and find out through
        the newspaper that this was happening just about everywhere in the
        world?”`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`David allowed a grin to emerge on his face. “Hmm. Can you be a little
        more specific?`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`President Jefferson allowed a chuckle. “When the toilets wouldn’t
        flush?”`}
      </p>
      <p>{`David pointed to her. “That’s the one!”`}</p>
      <p>
        {`It was finally good to laugh about the Great Power Outage. What an awful
        time, though. Summers were horrible, Winters were the worst.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`At least a lot of the technology still stuck around from the ‘Pre’ days.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`After a few chuckles, David let out a long sigh. “As you know, Russia’s
        been racing to build and open up its oil and gas pipelines into Europe
        ever since the power turned back on.`}
      </p>
      <p>{`The pen didn’t lift from the notebook. `}</p>
      <p>
        {`“Well, my client has been watching closely and learned that the
        pipelines are mainly flowing toward Western Europe, not Eastern.
        Russia’s been blowing sand in the wind with its negotiations with a lot
        of its closest neighbors.”`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`“Maybe because its neighbors in Eastern Europe don’t trust Russia?”`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`David shrugged and pulled out a white envelope bordered with a thin gold
        line. Harriet took it, feeling its suede-like texture.`}
      </p>
      <p>{`David spared no expense.`}</p>
      <p>
        {`He continued, “My client is hearing reports that Russian oil oligarchs
        are pushing the Tsar to invade Eastern Europe rather than settle for
        unfavorable negotiations. If we leave the FTA, the door is wide open for
        them to invade.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`“Shit.” She groaned as she opened the envelope. A small packet of paper,
        stapled at a perfect 45-degree angle to the corner, provided the intel.
        “I wish they’d just learn to negotiate instead of sending their citizens
        to death.”`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`David crossed his legs, laid one hand on top of the other, and placed
        them on his knees. In this pose, he studied her.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`“Between you and me, and I’ve given this some thought, it’d be much
        easier if Russia’s neighbors just united and defended themselves instead
        of relying on our help.”`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`President Jefferson scribbled profusely into her notebook. David opened
        up his mouth to continue convincing her, but she held up her hand.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`He backed down, and President Jefferson spun her chair around. She
        walked to the window to look out.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`David sat there, deciding to let her think on his pitch. She kept
        looking out the window, and David didn’t know what to do. Should he look
        at her, his notebook, or out the window too?`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`She turned around and went to her desk. She scribbled something again,
        then looked back up.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`David sat there, waiting for her to break the silence. She didn’t.
        Instead, she allowed a few more moments to sit in her thoughts.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`“Maybe we can let iron sharpen iron. Think you can unite them in a
        single country?”`}
      </p>
      <p>{`“Who?”`}</p>
      <p>{`“Russia’s neighbors.”`}</p>
      <p>{`“You don’t want to check with the State Department or CIA?”`}</p>
      <p>
        {`She shook her head. “This can’t be coming from the American government
        at all.”`}
      </p>
      <p>{`David winked. “Understood. And who’d pay me for this?” `}</p>
      <p>
        {`Harriet sat back in her chair. “Ask my friend Jura. She’s the head of a
       multinational prison company that’s flipped a pretty penny turning
       people away from violence. She should be able to pay for your services,
        and you two can work your magic to prevent more violence.”`}
      </p>
      <p>{`‘Work your magic.’ David loved the flattery. `}</p>
      <p>{`“Well, Madam President..” Now, he needed to be magical. `}</p>
      <p>
        {`He stood up, buttoning his jacket. This was certainly a challenge, but
        one he couldn’t resist.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`“Before the end of my story, between the banks of the Baltic, Black, and
        Adriatic Seas, a Great Nation will rise. That is a promise I swear to
        you, to myself, and to my God.”`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`President Jefferson shook his hand. She loved the confidence, but
        doubted it all the same.`}
