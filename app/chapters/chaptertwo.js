export const chaptertwo = `President Jefferson set the phone down. Her knees buckled. Atlas,  it appeared, set more weight on her shoulders. 
For years, a growing population in America felt like the  government hadn’t prioritized their needs. As a candidate, Harriet  made the promise that she’d pay attention. 
No matter how deeply she related to the story of a people starving  for freedom, starved by others who couldn’t understand or  empathize, her hands were tied. Democracy demanded it. 
She stood up tall and brought her chin up. She was President  Harriet Jefferson, after all. She wielded power that the first  President Jefferson couldn’t even imagine. 
She’d have to pull herself together before stepping into the Oval  to meet with David Perez. 
My dear reader, there is something you should understand about  David Perez. David Perez had a gravitational pull towards power.
So when President Jefferson walked into the Oval, the air was  thick. Both monitored their breathing, careful not to let their  powers collide. 
David lifted his shoulder as he extended a handshake. President  Jefferson was grateful David opted for the shake over the hug. 
“How can I help you, David?” 
David watched as President Jefferson settled behind the Resolute  Desk, opened her notebook, and clicked her pen. Always with that  damn notebook. It unnerved him to be in the presence of such a  prepared politician. 
“Madam President, I’m here today on behalf of my client, the Oil,  Gas, & Green Energy Industry Association. They’re having a cow  about leaving the Friends Together Alliance.” 
President Jefferson jotted something in her notebook. “Oh yea?” 
David composed himself. “You remember the Great Power  Outage?” 
She peered over her glasses. “You mean the one where I had to  learn to heat my house by woodfire, communicate by letter, and  find out through the newspaper that this was happening just about  everywhere in the world?” 
David allowed a grin to emerge on his face. “Hmm. Can you be a  little more specific?” 
President Jefferson allowed a chuckle. “When the toilets wouldn’t  flush?”
David pointed to her. “That’s the one!” 
It was finally good to laugh about the Great Power Outage. What  an awful time, though. Summers were horrible, Winters were the  worst. 
At least a lot of the technology still stuck around from the ‘Pre’  days. 
After a few chuckles, David let out a long sigh. “As you know,  Russia’s been racing to build and open up its oil and gas pipelines  into Europe ever since the power turned back on.” 
The pen didn’t lift from the notebook. 
“Well, my client has been watching closely and learned that the  pipelines are mainly flowing toward Western Europe, not Eastern.  Russia’s been blowing sand in the wind with its negotiations with a  lot of its closest neighbors.” 
“Maybe because its neighbors in Eastern Europe don’t trust  Russia?” 
David shrugged and pulled out a white envelope bordered with a  thin gold line. Harriet took it, feeling its suede-like texture. 
David spared no expense. 
He continued, “My client is hearing reports that Russian oil  oligarchs are pushing the Tsar to invade Eastern Europe rather  than settle for unfavorable negotiations. If we leave the FTA, the  door is wide open for them to invade.”
“Shit.” She groaned as she opened the envelope. A small packet of  paper, stapled at a perfect 45-degree angle to the corner, provided  the intel. “I wish they’d just learn to negotiate instead of sending  their citizens to death.” 
David crossed his legs, laid one hand on top of the other, and  placed them on his knees. In this pose, he studied her. 
“Between you and me, and I’ve given this some thought, it’d be  much easier if Russia’s neighbors just united and defended  themselves instead of relying on our help.” 
President Jefferson scribbled profusely into her notebook. David  opened up his mouth to continue convincing her, but she held up  her hand. 
He backed down, and President Jefferson spun her chair around.  She walked to the window to look out. 
David sat there, deciding to let her think on his pitch. She kept  looking out the window, and David didn’t know what to do.  Should he look at her, his notebook, or out the window too? 
She turned around and went to her desk. She scribbled something  again, then looked back up. 
David sat there, waiting for her to break the silence. She didn’t.  Instead, she allowed a few more moments to sit in her thoughts. 
“Maybe we can let iron sharpen iron. Think you can unite them in  a single country?” 
“Who?”
“Russia’s neighbors.” 
“You don’t want to check with the State Department or CIA?” 
She shook her head. “This can’t be coming from the American  government at all.” 
David winked. “Understood. And who’d pay me for this?” 
Harriet sat back in her chair. “Ask my friend Jura. She’s the head  of a multinational prison company that’s flipped a pretty penny  turning people away from violence. She should be able to pay for  your services, and you two can work your magic to prevent more  violence.” 
‘Work your magic.’ David loved the flattery. 
“Well, Madam President..” Now, he needed to be magical. 
He stood up, buttoning his jacket. This was certainly a challenge,  but one he couldn’t resist. 
“Before the end of my story, between the banks of the Baltic,  Black, and Adriatic Seas, a Great Nation will rise. That is a promise  I swear to you, to myself, and to my God.” 
President Jefferson shook his hand. She loved the confidence, but  doubted it all the same.
