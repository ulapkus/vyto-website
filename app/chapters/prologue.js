        {`Golden sap wept from a pine and entombed a bee as ancient as Mount
        Everest. Millions of years later, the amber gem became the prized
        possession of Jūratė, the mermaid queen of the Baltic Sea. The entombed
        bee bobbed along with the current, the morning sun casting its light
        through the waves, illuminating the amber's golden glow.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Jūratė stared into its tiny, ancient eyes. In silence, they spoke: `}
        <i>{`The Amber Bee chooses the Amber Queen.`}</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        {`What a fate—to rule over every fish, turtle, seagrass, and oyster in the
        sea, only to be ruled by a dead bee.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Golden sap wept And yet, she wanted this fate with every fiber of her
        being. She couldn&apos;t trust anyone else with this duty. No one else
        understood the threads that bound everything together the way she did.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`How the moon pulled at the sea. How violence and peace spread like
        tides. The connection between the past, present, and future.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`How men on land marched for war while the fish danced for freedom.
        Better to dance for freedom than march for war, she figured.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Sure, her fate came with its perks. She inherited a castle made entirely
        of amber that encased an island. Perhaps it was because of the castle —
        or maybe because she was the daughter of the thunder god, Perkūnas — but
        the other mermaids revered her.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`To the fish, she was a goddess. Even though like every ruler, they still
        found plenty to grumble about.`}

      <p>
        {`That fateful morning, as Jūratė studied the Amber Bee, a hook made of
        bone dropped into the water before her. She had seen such hooks before—a
        clever trick humans used to turn fish into food.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`However, Jūratė decided that today would be a good day to play a trick
        back on the human who had set the trap. She reached out with her hands
        and gently tugged on the rope. The hook immediately rose, and Jūratė
        followed. She gave the rope another tug and again, the hook rose higher.
        Instead of tugging on the rope a third time, Jūratė began quickly
        swimming up to the surface.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Time slowed for the fisherman as he watched a strange woman shoot up
        from the water.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Where he expected legs was a fin as wide as he was tall. The giant fin
        flipped towards him, knocking him off his raft and into the water. In
        the same motion, she arched backward into a flawless backflip.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`She plunged back into the waves, sending ripples through the water.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        {`The two were suspended in the water. The fisherman stared, wide-
        eyed—clearly, he had never seen a mermaid before.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        {`Jūratė was surprised too. What could she say? He was handsome. His long
        hair flowed through the water. His eyes were a piercing green, unlike
        anything Jūratė had ever seen. The two swam up to the surface and
        continued to stare each other in the eye. Jūratė began to giggle, and
        the person followed suit.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {` The giggling slowed, and Jūratė introduced herself. She pulled her hand
        towards her heart.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`"Jūratė."`}
        <i className="italics">{`You – Rah - Teh`}</i>
      </p>
      <p>{`The man had never heard a voice so beautiful. He blushed.`}</p>
      <p>
        {`"Kastytis."`}
        <i className="italics">{`Kuss – Tee - Tiss`}</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Just then, a sound of thunder rumbled overhead. To Kastytis, this meant
        he had to get his raft back to safety on the shore.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`For Jūratė, it meant something completely different. It was a warning
        from her father: 'Don&apos;t be with this person.'`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`As quickly as she could, Jūratė helped Kastytis back into the raft.
        Then, she dove beneath the surface, stewing in silence, her thoughts
        turning against her father.`}
      </p>
      <p>{`What the hell is wrong with finding a man handsome?`}</p>
      <p>
        {`So when the rumbling eventually stopped and the moon had come up, Jūratė
        went looking for Kastytis.`}
      </p>
      <p>{`She began to call out. "Kastyti! Kastyti!"`}</p>
      <p>{`Nothing.`}</p>
      <p>{`Again, Jūratė shouted, her voice rising. "Kastyti! Kastyti!"`}</p>
      <p>
        {`Instead of a response from Kastytis, Jūratė saw a lightning bolt crash
        into the sea. The wrong being had heard the shouting.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Jūratė swiftly dove back beneath the waves and began swimming towards
        her castle. Ahead, a vast blackness loomed in the sea.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`As she approached, she bumped into rocks and boulders, disoriented by
    the shadow. She wondered if the darkness of the night had played tricks
    on her eyes.`}
      </p>
      <p>{`She made it to the blackness and reached out her hand.`}</p>
      <p>{`Could he really have done it?!`}</p>
      <p>
        {`It was her castle, directly struck by Perkūnas' lightning bolt. The
        castle began breaking apart into the expanse of the sea.`}
      </p>
      <p>{`Jūratė shrieked. The fish darted away.`}</p>
      <p>
        {`Jūratė raced up to the surface, feeling the rain on her skin. She looked
        to the heavens and screamed.`}
        <i className="italics">{`"I will get my castle back. Whether in this
        life, the next, or however many generations it will take!"`}</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Jūratė took a breath, held the Amber Bee, and promised. "Čia
        pranešyste."`}
      </p>
      <p>
        <i className="italics">{`This is prophecy.`}</i>
