        Harriet and Jūratė are driven by power, fate, and myth.
      </p>
      <p className="chapter-text">
        Jūratė, that is You-Rah-Teh, hears the ghosts of Eastern Europe’s
        tragedies knocking on her door. Russia is signaling it wants to invade
        her country, threatening to make her part of the next generation of
        Eastern Europeans subject to war, genocide, and oppression. If she can
        channel the mermaid queen from Baltic Mythology for whom she is named,
        she believes she can break the cycle.
      </p>
      <p className="chapter-text">
        Harriet, that is President Harriet Jefferson, wields power her ancestor
        Thomas Jefferson couldn’t even imagine. Unbelievable that a descendant
        of one of his enslaved children would lead the humble nation he helped
        establish - now retreating from orchestrating the world’s economic and
        military architecture.
      </p>
      <p className="chapter-text">
        The world is changing. Americans voted for Harriet because they wanted a
        president who would pay attention to them, the American people. This
        demand from American democracy means that the security blanket
        protecting Jūratė’s home is disappearing fast.
      </p>
      <p className="chapter-text">
        As a friend, Harriet can’t let Jūratė and her people suffer. So they
        pursue an ambitious plan, to unite Eastern Europe into a new nation that
        can defend itself.
      </p>
      <p className="chapter-text">
        The thing is, Harriet and Jūratė are only human.
      </p>
      <p className="chapter-text">
        Jūratė doesn’t know if she’s deluding herself with ideas of fate. Her
        husband loves her and supports her ambitions, but honestly he’d rather
        just go fishing. And would Eastern Europe even want to unite?
      </p>
      <p className="chapter-text">
        Harriet feels the pull of everyone asking everything from her all the
        time. She could really use a break.
      </p>
      <p className="chapter-text">So what are they going to do?</p>
