        Vytas Aukstuolis is a 3rd (and 4th ) generation American. He grew up in
        a household that carried Lithuanian myth and language, which inspired
        his work. His background in lobbying gives him a front-row seat to watch
        the human side of power. Amber Queen is his debut novel.
